      <h3><strong>ABOUT THIS PROJECT</strong></h3>
      <p class="about">Welcome to GAMER GRID, the eccentric sister-project of <a href="https://danielledonnelly.github.io/media-masterlist-project/" class="light-link">Media Masterlist!</a> Media Masterlist is designed to be a simple yet sleek table for tracking your favourite media: books, music, movies, and more. 
      When I shared my Media Masterlist project, I got some great feedback that I should use a system like the <a href="https://api-docs.igdb.com/#cover" class="light-link">IGBD API</a> to pull covers for each entry to make things more visually interesting. </p>
      <p class="about">This API is specific to video games, so I decided to create a spinoff project focused entirely on games rather than all kinds of media. This also gave me the opportunity to experiment with some fun cyberpunk styling to fit the theme!</p>

    <h3><strong>HOW TO USE</strong></h3>
    <p class="about">Just type in a game title in the first column, and a cover for the game should appear. Then, you can give the game a rating, add additional info like the genre or platform, and even write a review! Click the save button to save your progress for the next time you visit the page, or click export to export your list as a CSV.
    </p><p class="about">If you don't like the cover that's pulled, you can copy an image and paste it in manually. Here's an example of how the table can look when filled out, using my own personal <a href="https://danielledonnelly.github.io/my-gamer-grid/" class="light-link">Top 10 Games List</a>.</p>

        <h3><strong>SPECIAL THANKS</strong></h3>
        <p class="about">I owe a huge thank you to Jillian Breau for her amazing mentorship and guidance. 
        I also want to give a shoutout to my mom, who unknowingly kickstarted my passion for technology and gaming at an early age when she gave me my first console, a pink Nintendo DS. This project is a homage to that special memory.</p>
