      <h3><strong>WHAT IS THIS? </strong></h3>
      <p>Welcome to GAMER GRID, the eccentric sister-project of <a href="media-masterlist" class="light-link">Media Masterlist!</a> Media Masterlist is designed to be a simple, sleek and sophisticated table for tracking your favourite media: that can include books, music, television shows, and more. 
        I wanted to make a more technical project with a similar concept using an API. Creating a playful game-based project seemed like a fun opportunity to try something new and implement some over-the-top retro cyberpunk vaporwave styling!</p> 
    </div><br>

  
    <div class="question">
      <h3><strong>WHAT INSPIRED THIS PROJECT?</strong></h3>
      <p>When I shared my Media Masterlist project, I got feedback that I should try implementing <a href="https://api-docs.igdb.com/#cover" class="light-link">IGBD API</a> so that when someone types in a game title, a game cover would generate beside the entry. I loved the idea, but I wanted to keep Media Masterlist flexible and minimalistic, without restricting users to just listing games.
      That's when I realized that this would be a fun opportunity to make a new project focused on video games with some maximalist styling! I wanted to have a lot of fun with the design, which was partially inspired by the fun retro styling of the DO IT Hackathon <a href="https://ecumene.github.io/dontoverthinkit/" class="light-link">web page. </a></p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="question">
      <h3><strong>WHAT ARE <I>YOUR</I> FAVOURITE GAMES?</strong></h3>
      <p>Check my personal top 10 games list <a href="https://danielledonnelly.github.io/my-media-list/" class="light-link">here!</a> I plan on making another list like it using the Gamer Grid UI, but for now it's laid out using the Media Masterlist styling.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="question">
      <h3><strong>WHAT DO YOU DO?</strong></h3>
      <p>I'm a marketing specialist with Atlantic Edge Credit Union <b>(you should join your local credit union by the way, please go do so right now).</b> I can sincerely say that I love my job, and there's nowhere else I'd rather be working. I'm also a student with Get Coding, which has been an amazing experience! Having the opportunity to learn, write, design, and develop on a daily basis has been a dream come true for me. While I am considering offering freelance services in the near future, I don't plan on becoming a <i>full-time</i> developer.</p> 
    </div><br>

    <div class="question">
      <h3><strong>WHAT WILL YOU BUILD NEXT?</strong></h3>
      <p>I don't know yet! I'm thinking my next big project will be a game of some kind, but I want to work on a lot of smaller projects along the way. Mastering both JavaScript and React is my next major coding goal. I'd also really love to work on some collaborative projects.</p>
